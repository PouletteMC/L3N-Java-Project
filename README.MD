![TeamCity build status](https://city.lostanddead.co.uk/app/rest/builds/buildType:id:Poulette_L3nJavaProject_Build/statusIcon.svg)

## Initial setup

If you're using IntelliJ IDEA you can simply run the `Main` class.
On the other hand, if you're using Eclipse, you can run the `Main` class by right-clicking on it and selecting `Run As > Java Application`.

## Testing

This project uses JUnit 5 for unit testing. You can run the tests by right-clicking on the `src/test/java` folder and selecting "Run 'All Tests'" or by running the "test" script in the maven tab.

All the test are in the `src/test/java` folder.

## Disclaimer

Running the jar in a Windows terminal (PS/CMD) will not work. You need to use a unix terminal (like git bash or WSL) or a unix system. Running the app through IDEA will work regardless of the platform.
